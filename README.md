# TFT Roll Sim
A website the simulates the rolling gameplay of TFT designed to improve your roll down mechanics. It works by allowing a user to save a starting position (units on board, gold, level, etc.) and allows them to roll down from this position.

## About 
The app simulates the core rolling mechanics of TFT, including: 
- Tier odds based on levels
- Champion odds based on fixed pool sizes
- Champions being removed from pool on purchase
- 3* champions on your board will be removed entirely from the pool
- Needing space on bench so a unit can be purchased
- Upgrading champions to a higher level (2* or 3*)
- Pressing D or clicking the roll button to roll
- Showing active traits based on units placed on the board

## How to play 
The intended use, is for a user to set a starting point including champions that exist on your board, gold and level. This is done by clicking the edit button, which opens a menu that shows all the settings you may want to change. After you have the board to start from, click the "Save Settings" button as it will allow you to get multiple attempts at rolling from this spot. From here you simply begin the roll down and can retry by using the refresh or restart buttons. 

## Build details 
The app is made with React.ts, intended only for use on a computer.
